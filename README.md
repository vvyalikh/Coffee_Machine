2. create 3 opportunities: make coffee, print resources report, and turn Coffee Machine off
3. functions: to check if resources are sufficient, process coin calculation, check if the transaction is successful 
and to make coffee, if it is possible.
4. when coffee is made ingredients should be deducted from the resources, but coins should be added to the profit.
